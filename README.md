# 🎨 Damien Hirst Dot Painting with Turtle Graphics.
This project is a Python recreation of one of Damien Hirst’s iconic dot paintings, using the turtle graphics library.

Hirst originally created this artwork to highlight how the pharmaceutical industry presents colourful pills in a visually appealing way, often masking the serious implications behind them. 
Inspired by that concept, this code generates a vibrant dot grid that mimics the structured, colourful aesthetics of Hirst’s style.

    Python code using turtle to draw a 10x10 grid of randomly colored dots.
    
    Custom colour palette inspired by a Damien Hirst piece.
